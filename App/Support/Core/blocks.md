# Blocks

All content within a web page is loaded within blocks, which means that you'll be able to drag & drop [components](core/components) into blocks. Each [area](core/areas) within the [page layout](core/page-layout) will consist of at least one block. If more than one block is loaded into an area, they will be stacked vertically.

## Custom blocks
Some blocks are page-specific, and other blocks are website-specific and can be loaded across several pages. For example, the website logo & menu would exist within a custom block that is loaded into the head area of every web page.

## Page-specific Blocks

Each a[rea](core/areas) within the page layout will consist of a page-specific block that will only load on the page it belongs to. You can add content to these blocks, or you can leave them empty and only use custom blocks to create content with. It's up to you, the designer.
