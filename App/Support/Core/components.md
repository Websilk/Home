# Components

Nearly all of the content that you'll create for your websites within the Websilk platform will consist of `components`. You can drag & drop components (such as text, photos, & menus) directly onto your web pages from within the [Page Editor](editor).

## Custom Properties
When editing the page, you can edit [custom properties](editor/component-properties) for your components. For example, you can upload an image to load within a `photo component`, or you can add a new menu item to your `menu component`.
