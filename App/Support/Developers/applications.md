# Developing Applications
#### For the Websilk platform

Adding custom functionality to your website may require you to develop a vendor application for Websilk. For example, a shopping cart system or user commenting system would require a vendor application to be developed. 

It may sound like a daunting task to create an entire "application" for a CMS platform, but you will be suprised to find that it is extremely easy to do with Websilk.
